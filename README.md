# Linux scripts
#### This repository will contain samples of all my scripts written for the linux operating system. 
More scripts should come out soon.:wink:
## Description
1. **sshd_config_file_modification**</br>
This is a simple script that replaces one command in the sshd file `PermitRootLogin` with another `PermitRootLogin without-password`.
In fact, the script searches for the line containing the given text in the file and replaces it with the new value. 
The new value will be inserted exactly in the place of the found line.
